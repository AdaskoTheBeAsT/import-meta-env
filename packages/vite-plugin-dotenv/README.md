This plugin extends vite's built-in [environment variables](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-variables) functionality to inject your environment variables at runtime instead of build time.

This project use [SemVer](https://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the tags on this repository.

## üí° How

In production, this package will generate some files in your dist assets directory that allow us to inject environment variables _after building the package_.

- `dist/assets/.env` is a `.env` file whose contents are generated from `import.meta.env`, **feel free to change the environment variables** in this file before serving your application.

- `dist/assets/env.js` contains a placeholder: `__env__` which allows us to inject environment variables.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Install the plugin:

```sh
pnpm i vite-plugin-dotenv
```

Register the plugin:

```js
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import dotenv from "vite-plugin-dotenv";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [dotenv()],
});
```

Finally, remember to inject environment variables before serving your application.

Since our programs all run on different operating systems (for example, you might develop with Windows/MacOS but deploy to linux), we do not provide binaries for injecting environment variables.

We recommend that you install [sd](https://github.com/chmln/sd) - an intuitive find and replace CLI written in rust that helps us run the same script in different operating systems, for example:

```sh
# Find __env__ and replace it with .env content
sd __env__ "\`$(cat dist/assets/.env)\n\`" dist/assets/env.js
```

If you run into problems, see [examples](../examples) or create an issue from github.

## üìñ Plugin Options

- `placeholder: string = "__env__"`: The placeholder to replace with the `.env` file content

- `verify: boolean = true`: Whether to verify the `.env` file content at runtime

- `debug: boolean = false`: Whether to dump debug logs, logs will be dumped to <package-root>/vite-plugin-dotenv-debug.log

Inject your environment variables from the .env file at runtime instead of build time.

In development, this package just injects the vite environment variables as-is.

In production, this package will generate some files in your dist assets directory (see below) that allow us to inject the environment variables _after building the package_.

This project use [SemVer](https://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the tags on this repository.

‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT** add secret environment to `<package-root>/dist/assets/.env`, the [shell script](https://github.com/iendeavor/vite-plugin-dotenv/tree/main/packages/vite-plugin-dotenv#:~:text=%3Cpackage%2Droot%3E/dist/assets/.env.sh%20is%20a%20shell%20script%20that%20injects%20%3Cpackage%2Droot%3E/dist/assets/.env%20into%20%3Cpackage%2Droot%3E/dist/assets/env.js.) will inject everything from it into `<package-root>/dist/assets/env.js`.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Install the plugin:

```sh
pnpm i vite-plugin-dotenv
```

Register the plugin:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import dotenv from "vite-plugin-dotenv";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [dotenv()],
});
```

Use it:

```
# .env
VITE_NAME=vite-plugin-dotenv
```

```ts
// main.ts
// @ts-ignore: If you are using typescript ignore next line to prevent ts(2307) error.
import env from "env"; // This is a virtual file automatically generated by this plugin

console.log(`Hollo ${env.VITE_NAME}`); // Hello vite-plugin-dotenv
```

After building the package, you will have following files in dist:

- `<package-root>/dist/assets/.env` is cloned from `<package-root>/.env` as is, feel free to change environment variables in this file before serving your app.

- `<package-root>/dist/assets/env.js` contains a placeholder: `__env__`, which allows us to inject environment variables.

- `<package-root>/dist/assets/.env.sh` is a shell script that injects `<package-root>/dist/assets/.env` into `<package-root>/dist/assets/env.js`.

Before serving your website, you need to inject environment variables:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "preview": "./dist/assets/.env.sh && vite preview"
  }
}
```

If you run into problems, see [examples](../examples) or create an issue from github.

## Integration

### jest

For jest, we have to mock virtual file before running tests:

```ts
// tests/setup.ts
jest.mock(
  "env",
  () => ({
    VITE_NAME: "vite-plugin-dotenv",
  }),
  { virtual: true }
);
```

```ts
// jest.config.ts
export default {
  // ...

  setupFiles: ["<rootDir>/test/setup.ts"],
};
```
